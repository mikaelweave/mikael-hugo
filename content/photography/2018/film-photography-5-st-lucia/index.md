I traveled to St. Lucia for my fourth and fifth rolls of film! My fiancée [Katy](http://www.katyweaver.com/){:target=\"_blank\"} was doing photography for a beautiful elopement there and captured some amazing moments. Her [day before photos are here](https://katyweaverblog.com/2018/04/21/st-lucia-pre-wedding-photos-calabash-cove/){:target=\"_blank\"}, [elopement day photos are here](https://katyweaverblog.com/2018/04/25/calabash-cove-st-lucia-wedding/){:target=\"_blank\"}, and [day after photos are here](https://katyweaverblog.com/2018/05/16/wedding-photos-soufriere-st-lucia/){:target=\"_blank\"}. I was lucky enough to be able to travel with her and we spent a few days in and around Soufrière after the elopement. All of these photos were taken there.

These shots were taken on 120 with my precious Yashica. It was my third roll through the camera and I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of this machine (and 120 a bit). I'm pretty happy with the results. Funny story though – I had the camera set on 240 instead of 120, so at the end of my trip I was running around frantically trying to take cool photos (so I didn't have to x-ray the film) just in case I loaded it with 240 by accident. It ended up being 120 and the film turned out fine.

**Camera:** Yashica Mat 124G
**Film:** Kodak Portra 400 (120)

Katy's clients were happy to let me snap a couple photos.

Using up the film on the last day. I hoard it over trips and then use the rest so quickly.
