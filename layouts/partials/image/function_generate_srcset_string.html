    FUNCTION:    image/function_generate_srcset_string.html

    DESCRIPTION: Takes a slice of image detail objects as an input and returns a string that
                 can be used for an image element srcset

    INPUT:       Slice (Hugo list) of image detail objects. These objects are expected to have
                 the following properties:
                    - extension: image extension as we are dealing with webp and the orig format
                    - scaleFactor: used for sorting as higher scale factors need to be made available first
                    - width: the original image width
                    - path: the path to the image to be rendered on the page

    OUTPUT:      A string that can be plugged into a HTML img element as srcset
